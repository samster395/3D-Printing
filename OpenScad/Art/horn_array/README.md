# Parametric Spiral Horn Array - Work in progress

I have been working on parametric wall art inspired by inspired by [this](https://i.imgur.com/Kc8Cd5w.png) sculpture made by [Herschel Shapiro](https://www.tiktok.com/@herschelshapiro/video/7225225819789036805).

Ive been trying to recreate it in OpenSCAD, made some good progress so far, obviosuly I need to tweak the values that define how they point but im happy with my progress so far.

### To do
 - Adjust horn twist parameter for better results
 - Probably add mating interfaces on each horn as seen on Herschel's Horns

Any feedback is welcome, best place is probably the [Printables Page](https://www.printables.com/model/738765/).

### Credits
I am new to OpenSCAD so needed to take some bits of code from elsewhere to achieve what I wanted, I realise these may be very simple for someone who knows what they're doing but I didnt, so credit is due.
